## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This one was a bit of a challenge in getting everything right and then doing the mobile solution afterwards. I should have gone for a mobile first workflow and should have also tried to refactor everything which I may come back to at a later point but took me a few days to get it completed.

### Continued development

Need to recap on grid and flow as always seem to have issues with following the layouts fully.
